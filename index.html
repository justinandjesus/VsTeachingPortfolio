          <p>As a teacher of Chinese, my primary aim is to enhance the Chinese communication skills of my students. This is possible by a synergistic effort between the students and I to also increase their proclivity for the language and their desire to continue learning.</p>
          <p>My desire is to facilitate a class in such a way that I function not only as a teacher delivering information but all the more, that I would be a facilitator who is able to initiate the process of learning for each student in the class such that they would leave the class with a spirit to begin to delve deeper into the subject on their own even outside of class.</p>
          <p>When students sit in my class, my goal is that they shall, in the course of the teaching, progress from whichever state they were in initially. Whether they be in the infancy stage and need gracious attention in broad categories or whether they be in the more advanced stages and need careful assistance in the minute details, my goal is that they should move to the next level and be one step closer to fluency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <p>The classroom must be a dynamic place where each student is given the opportunity to interact. It is meant to be a place where students feel comfortable in making mistakes while learning without feeling judged. It is meant to be a friendly environment wherein students are encouraged to continue developing their language skills and encourage others to do the same. </p>
          <p>I believe that the class should be based on tasks and am hence approaching classroom teaching with a Task Based Language Learning method. I believe that this approach is most beneficial for the students since there is not only input given to them but there is also output which opens up more opportunities such as feedback, correction, etc.</p>
          <p>My ultimate role in the lives of my students is to walk alongside them as a teacher, mentor, facilitator, friend, and advisor as they journey this path to reach the final goal of fluency and accuracy.</p>

      <h2>What makes a good language lesson?</h2>
      <p>Here’s one of my reflections on the courses I have taken, especially the courses "Methodology and Course Design" and "Supervised Teaching Practicum" in the past one year. There is one thing I would like to share about: What is a good lesson? The approach is based on pedagogical theories, my own teaching experience, and peers’ feedback.</p>
      <br /><p>The table below is quoted from the course Methodology and Curriculum Design (5002), both teachers and students would love to have a fun class, and for sure teachers’ goal is students take away something from the lesson, yet from students’ view, they prefer interaction with teachers and peers, hence teachers should keep in mind what students are looking for from the lesson. </p>

      <p>I think what a good language lesson for advanced learners is varied from for novice learners or intermediate learners. <br />
      <br />
      What’s a good language lesson for advanced-level learners?<br />
      Clear objectives are very important. When planning a lesson, I need to think about what students are going to learn from this lesson and why does it matter to them.<br />
      <br />
      Give students ownership by tapping into their interests, encouraging peer review, and empowering them autonomy, in other words, allow them to choose.<br />
      <br />
      Other than these, allowing students to have their reflection is essential. I should leave some time for them to practice and reflect on what they have just learnt, how they can implement out of the classroom, and allow them to ask questions if they have any. <br />
      <br />

      What’s a good language lesson for novice learners or intermediate learners? <br />
      How I organize the lesson content has to be more logical and contextualized, the procedure has to be more coherent, and the expected output from students is lower. <br />
      <br />
      However, a good lesson regardless students’ language levels and course types does share similarities. For example, a good lesson should motivate students to learn; the sequencing of learning activities must be coherent; teacher should provide opportunities for students to use language in a meaningful way, making tasks more meaningful to students, and giving more time for students’ extended practice. <br />
      <br />
      There are many factors for creating a good lesson, yet not every good lesson has the same factors rather they are dynamic, just like what Tudor (1998, p.319) once said, “the reality of language teaching and learning emerges from a dynamic interaction of individual and socio-cultural rationalities, a process which is unique to each classroom and which can rarely be predicted in advance” Tudor (1998, p.319). Teachers need to be more flexible in class and be always prepared to have “surprises” to come.

          <p>For myself, I like to present myself to students as a professional, approachable, relaxed and humorous teacher. <br> <br>
In aiming for full engagement, it is essential that students perceive activities as being meaningful. To ensure that activities are personally meaningful, for example, connect them with their previous knowledge and experiences, highlighting the value of an assigned activity in personally relevant ways. Also, demonstrate why an individual activity is worth pursuing, and when and how it is used in real life. <br> <br>
In addition, I like to help students to foster a sense of competence. When students try to evaluate themselves personally, they can succeed in the learning activities or challenges. In order to achieve this, what I need to keep in mind is the assigned activities can be only slightly beyond students' current levels of proficiency, allow students to demonstrate their understanding throughout the activities. Also, always recognize students’ improvement and efforts and show my appreciations in class.  <br> <br>
Encouraging collaborative learning in class. I like to put students into pairs or groups, and together they share the knowledge they have to accomplish the tasks productively. Through this, each student’s individual accountability will be cultivated by assigning different roles.<br> <br>
Establishing approachable and positive teacher-student relationship. “Love my students” would be 3 words that I always remind myself of. Besides academic needs, I show my love towards my students by treating them with kindness and patience; showing my attitudes and enthusiasm positively; and caring about their individual emotional and social needs.</p>

        <p>In January 2018, I partook an internship at Kurmul International School in Cambodia for 3 weeks. I taught grade 1 Mandarin Chinese, grade 7 and 8 English. I was provided with the course curriculum and teacher’s books and I needed to prepare each lesson myself. For Mandarin Chinese classes, the school has their own materials, while for English, they use Oxford curriculum. <br> <br>
In 2017, I worked in Zenith Kindergarten & International Nursery for half a year. I was a Mandarin teacher and the main playgroup teacher in the school. My kids were from 9 months to 7 years old. <br> <br>
For nursery to K.3, my job responsibilities were to teach them Mandarin Chinese by telling them stories, doing different class activities like role-play, re-tell the stories, and singing songs etc. In addition, I taught K2 to K3 kids to write Chinese characters and marked their assignments. <br> <br>
For playgroup, I partnered with an English-native speaking teacher and we together planned each lesson such as which story book to tell, what motor-skill activity to do, what art to paint or to make, what songs to play etc. We needed to prepare all the materials that were needed on our own. Like making the art examples, cutting the things for art activities, getting the things ready for motor skills activities etc. We tried to have specific themes for each lesson and each month, like one of the lessons, the theme was transportation and the toys, story, art work, and music were all related to the theme. Each lesson was about 90 minutes and was consisted of 7 sessions – toys time, stories time, motor skills activity time, tea time, arts time, music time, and playgroup time. <br> <br>
Other than formal teaching, I like doing volunteering works related to teaching as well. In 2014 to 2015, I went to Guangzhou Recovery Trial School weekly to visit the kids and the teens there and to help them with their assignments. I also went to a touristy place Guilin in China where minorities live there. I taught them easy and practical English as a part of the development of its tourism. This year when I was in Cambodia doing my internship, I stayed in a children house called Haley’s House (HH). Some of them go to the school where I did my internships and after school I would help teaching those children in HH to do their homework and played with them.

    <p class="tp-text">The Supervised Teaching Practicum has provided me with the opportunity to practically apply, in a live classroom setting, the insights I have gained from studying the theoretical aspects of second language education.

In keeping with the practical nature of the course, the teaching will involve workshop activities, observation of actual language classes, micro-teaching, and supervised teaching practice. This semester I was assigned to do class observation in a Cantonese level 1 course and I was allowed to do two teaching practices in the class that I had observed. The classroom observations and teaching practice took place in the Centre for Language Education, and I was attached to experienced CLE instructors, who acted as mentors throughout the Practicum.</p>

    <p>I really liked it! I can tell you prepared a lot, and we also did the activity to revise what we just learned, which was useful for digesting new words. I think the teaching speed was okay for Julia and me becuase we can easily relate it to some chinese words we already know, but to those people who havent seen those words, it might be little difficult, so I think it would be better if you slow down little bit to make sure everyone understands next time! Additionally, I think the content was very useful, your explanation was easy to understand.</p>
