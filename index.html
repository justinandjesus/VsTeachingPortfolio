      <div class="textAboutMe">
        <div class="">
          <p>As a teacher of Chinese, my primary aim is to enhance the Chinese communication skills of my students. This is possible by a synergistic effort between the students and I to also increase their proclivity for the language and their desire to continue learning.</p>
          <p>My desire is to facilitate a class in such a way that I function not only as a teacher delivering information but all the more, that I would be a facilitator who is able to initiate the process of learning for each student in the class such that they would leave the class with a spirit to begin to delve deeper into the subject on their own even outside of class.</p>
          <p>When students sit in my class, my goal is that they shall, in the course of the teaching, progress from whichever state they were in initially. Whether they be in the infancy stage and need gracious attention in broad categories or whether they be in the more advanced stages and need careful assistance in the minute details, my goal is that they should move to the next level and be one step closer to fluency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <p>The classroom must be a dynamic place where each student is given the opportunity to interact. It is meant to be a place where students feel comfortable in making mistakes while learning without feeling judged. It is meant to be a friendly environment wherein students are encouraged to continue developing their language skills and encourage others to do the same. </p>
          <p>I believe that the class should be based on tasks and am hence approaching classroom teaching with a Task Based Language Learning method. I believe that this approach is most beneficial for the students since there is not only input given to them but there is also output which opens up more opportunities such as feedback, correction, etc.</p>
          <p>My ultimate role in the lives of my students is to walk alongside them as a teacher, mentor, facilitator, friend, and advisor as they journey this path to reach the final goal of fluency and accuracy.</p>

      <h2>What makes a good language lesson?</h2>
      <p>The table below is quoted from the course Methodology and Curriculum Design (5002), both teachers and students would love to have a fun class, and for sure teachers’ goal is students take away something from the lesson, yet from students’ view, they prefer interaction with teachers and peers, hence teachers should keep in mind what students are looking for from the lesson. </p>

      <p>I think what a good language lesson for advanced learners is varied from for novice learners or intermediate learners. <br />
      <br />
      What’s a good language lesson for advanced-level learners?<br />
      Clear objectives are very important. When planning a lesson, I need to think about what students are going to learn from this lesson and why does it matter to them.<br />
      <br />
      Give students ownership by tapping into their interests, encouraging peer review, and empowering them autonomy, in other words, allow them to choose.<br />
      <br />
      Other than these, allowing students to have their reflection is essential. I should leave some time for them to practice and reflect on what they have just learnt, how they can implement out of the classroom, and allow them to ask questions if they have any. <br />
      <br />

      What’s a good language lesson for novice learners or intermediate learners? <br />
      How I organize the lesson content has to be more logical and contextualized, the procedure has to be more coherent, and the expected output from students is lower. <br />
      <br />
      However, a good lesson regardless students’ language levels and course types does share similarities. For example, a good lesson should motivate students to learn; the sequencing of learning activities must be coherent; teacher should provide opportunities for students to use language in a meaningful way, making tasks more meaningful to students, and giving more time for students’ extended practice. <br />
      <br />
      There are many factors for creating a good lesson, yet not every good lesson has the same factors rather they are dynamic, just like what Tudor (1998, p.319) once said, “the reality of language teaching and learning emerges from a dynamic interaction of individual and socio-cultural rationalities, a process which is unique to each classroom and which can rarely be predicted in advance” Tudor (1998, p.319). Teachers need to be more flexible in class and be always prepared to have “surprises” to come.

    <p>I really liked it! I can tell you prepared a lot, and we also did the activity to revise what we just learned, which was useful for digesting new words. I think the teaching speed was okay for Julia and me becuase we can easily relate it to some chinese words we already know, but to those people who havent seen those words, it might be little difficult, so I think it would be better if you slow down little bit to make sure everyone understands next time! Additionally, I think the content was very useful, your explanation was easy to understand.</p>
